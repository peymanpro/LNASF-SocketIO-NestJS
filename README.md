# NestJS + Socket.IO Chat Backend

A small real-time public-chat backend built with NestJS, its WebSocket gateway abstraction, and Socket.IO. The implementation keeps chat events in a gateway, validates untrusted payloads, and exposes origin configuration for local or deployed clients.

## Features

- Socket.IO events for joining, welcome messages, chat messages, presence, join/leave notices, and typing indicators.
- Server-side validation for display names and message text.
- Unique message IDs per published message.
- A client must join before it can publish messages or typing status.
- Duplicate join requests for the same socket and display name do not produce duplicate presence announcements.
- CORS allow-list and port can be configured with environment variables.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or later
- npm

## Run locally

```bash
npm ci
npm run start:dev
```

The service listens on port `5000` by default. Set `PORT` to use another port.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `5000` | HTTP and Socket.IO listener port |
| `CHAT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:3000` | Comma-separated list of browser origins |

Example:

```bash
CHAT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000 npm run start:dev
```

Only configure trusted origins in a deployed environment. CORS is not authentication; this sample does not implement identity, authorization, persistence, or rate limiting.

## Event contract

| Direction | Event | Payload |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Client → server | `user-join` | `string username` |
| Client → server | `send-message` | `{ message: string }` |
| Client → server | `typing-start` | no payload |
| Client → server | `typing-stop` | no payload |
| Server → client | `welcome` | `{ message, users: string[] }` |
| Server → client | `user-joined` | `{ username, message, time }` |
| Server → client | `user-left` | `{ username, message, time }` |
| Server → client | `new-message` | `{ username, message, time, id, senderId }` |
| Server → client | `online-users` | `string[]` |
| Server → client | `user-typing` | `{ username, isTyping }` |
| Server → client | `chat-error` | `{ code, message }` |

Display names are trimmed and limited to 32 characters; messages are trimmed and limited to 2,000 characters. Empty strings, control characters, non-string values, and messages sent before joining are rejected with `chat-error`.

## Example client

```js
import { io } from "socket.io-client";

const socket = io("http://localhost:5000");
socket.emit("user-join", "Ada");
socket.on("welcome", console.log);
socket.emit("send-message", { message: "Hello from Socket.IO" });
socket.on("new-message", console.log);
socket.on("chat-error", console.error);
```

## Validation

```bash
npm run build
npm test
```

The automated suite covers validation boundaries, the native model and policy, Passive/Advisory/Adaptive behavior, fallback, and a live two-client Socket.IO integration test. The integration test boots the actual NestJS application on an ephemeral local port and verifies that Adaptive mode suppresses duplicate typing-start events without suppressing typing-stop or a primary chat message. It checks event delivery, not throughput or user-perceived latency. GitHub Actions builds the application and runs the suite on pushes and pull requests.

## LNASF: native typing-burst adaptation

`src/lnasf/typing-adaptation.ts` implements the Observe–Learn–Predict–Decide–Adapt–Measure path using an in-process frequency model over inter-arrival gaps between typing-start events. The Gateway delegates the decision and only suppresses duplicate typing-start notifications; typing-stop, chat messages, and validation remain non-adaptive.

Set `LNASF_MODE=passive` (default), `advisory`, or `adaptive` before starting the backend. Passive learns without changing delivery. Advisory reports a recommendation without applying it. Adaptive requires at least five learned gaps and confidence of at least 0.60 before applying a bounded 150–500 ms duplicate cooldown; insufficient evidence falls back to broadcasting. `GET /lnasf/metrics` exposes evidence, the current prediction and decision, and measured suppression counters. State is process-local and resets on restart.

LNASF tests use deterministic timestamps and directly verify the model, policy separation, modes, and fallback. No performance gain is claimed without live multi-client benchmarking.



Framework context: [LNASF concept and architecture](https://github.com/peymanpro/learning-native-adaptive-software-framework) · [Technical specification](https://github.com/peymanpro/learning-native-adaptive-software-framework/blob/main/SPECIFICATION.md). This repository implements only the specific LNASF subset documented above; it is not a complete framework implementation.

## Dependency audit status

The project is aligned on NestJS 12 and TypeScript 5.9, with the lockfile regenerated and validated by CI. The current audit summary is recorded in GitHub Actions after the dependency update; review the latest audit output before treating this project as production-ready. No `--force` dependency upgrade is used. An advisory count does not by itself prove runtime exploitability, but unresolved critical or high findings must be triaged before release.

## Limitations

Presence is held in process memory and is lost on restart. Multiple instances do not share presence; configure a compatible Socket.IO adapter before horizontal scaling. This project is a portfolio sample, not a secured production messaging service.
